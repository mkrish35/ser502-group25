Language Name: Mint  
=====================

Individual Contribution  
------------------------

Kiran Venkatachalam  
- Assisted in testing the lexer rules using regular expressions.
- Prepared the README.md and initial documentation.
- Contributed in writing one sample program to verify tokenization and parse tree generation.
- Helped in the grammar design document in EBNF format.
- Contributed to define ANTLR build process and verified grammar outputs through sample mint programs.
- Assisted in developing the evaluator file and modifying exisiting sample testcase to execute properly.
- Led the integration and refinement of new .mint sample programs, ensuring all grammar rules and constructs were covered.
- Finalized the updated README.md structure and milestone documentation with detailed build/run instructions and program summaries.
- Contributed content ideas and flow structure for the team’s final presentation PDF.

Monisha Krishnamurthy  
- Worked on defining token types and their corresponding lexer rules.
- Contributed to cleaning up the grammar syntax and ensuring EBNF consistency.
- Helped set up the ANTLR build process and assisted in testing grammar outputs.
- Verified grammar correctness using sample `.mint` programs.
- Reviewed and edited documentation content.
- Contributed to developing the evaluator by implementing logic to process and evaluate logical, equality, and ternary expressions with proper type checking.
- Validated evaluator logic for corner cases in ternary and logical expressions using test samples and ensured type safety throughout.
- Contributed to the final grammar cleanup and verified grammar-evaluator alignment by cross-checking all sample program executions.
- Participated in drafting diagrams and overview slides for the team’s final presentation PDF.

Rahul Ravindra Reddy  
- Participated in grammar design discussions and token definition refinement.
- Assisted in debugging ANTLR generation and grammar testing issues.
- Helped validate the lexer/parser integration with ANTLR TestRig.
- Collaborated on drafting the language design PDF and verified formatting.
- Provided sample test case scenarios for grammar validation.
- Implemented evaluation logic for chained comparison expressions (e.g., <, <=, >, >=).
- Added support for string concatenation in additive expressions using the + operator.
- Developed logic for multiplicative operations (*, /, %) with type safety and zero-division checks.
- Handled primary expression evaluation including literals (int, float, bool, string), variables, and nested expressions.
- Ran comprehensive tests across all 10 .mint programs, refining evaluation logic where needed to handle edge cases smoothly.
- Helped structure the final presentation content and coordinated grammar verification for the final milestone.
- Reviewed and revised technical explanation slides for the final presentation PDF.

Vishnu Kumar Adhilakshmi Kalidas  
- Contributed to defining control flow structures (`if`, `for`, `while`) in grammar and in designing Lexer rules using regex.
- Helped create and refine example programs demonstrating language features.
- Participated in reviewing the EBNF grammar rules and refining parser rules.
- Contributed to structure and content of documentation for milestone submission.
- Helped maintain consistency across grammar file, samples, and documentation.
- Implemented evaluator logic for variable assignment with type checking, and extended support for for loops with break and continue control flow handling.
- Refactored the evaluator’s loop handling to support correct break/continue behavior inside while and for blocks.
- Assisted in debugging sample program logic for accurate output and correct parse tree generation.
- Provided use case examples and program flow breakdowns for inclusion in the final presentation PDF.

Collaborative Efforts  
---------------------
- The team jointly designed the overall structure and theme of the Mint language.
- Grammar rules and tokens were discussed and finalized collaboratively.
- All team members participated in peer review, testing, and debugging.
- Sample programs were tested and iterated together.
- Final documents including README, grammar PDF, and contribution.txt were reviewed as a group.
- All team members collaborated to thoroughly test the interpreter against new sample programs and validate output consistency.
- Final milestone deliverables (sample programs, grammar, evaluator, README, contribution, and presentation PDF) were reviewed and polished as a team.
